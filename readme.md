To visualize the measurement data, download and install the Polytec software update (Windows systems only):
https://www.polytec.com/int/vibrometry/products/software/polytec-update

The data files can be viewed using Polytec Scan Viewer.

The folders asymmetric_new and symmetric_new_repeat contain laser scanning vibrometer measurements of asymmetric and symmetric sonic black holes, respectively. The folder Num_center_pressure contains numerically extracted centerline pressure data. The Simulation_Trans_Ref folder contains numerical transmission coefficient data for both asymmetric and symmetric sonic black holes, while the Exp_Trans_Ref folder contains experimental transmission coefficient data calculated from the measurements.

The Python script Center_pre.py is provided to plot the centerline pressure magnitude and to compare numerical and experimental results. The transmission_comparison.py script compares numerical and experimental transmission coefficients.

waveguide_center.py consists of code used to plot figures in the supplementary material section
